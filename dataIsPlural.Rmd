Perhaps the most contentious scientific argument of the early twenty-first century concerns whether "data" is plural or singular. To accidentally say "data is" at a prestigious conference is to lob a metaphorical lettuce into the traditionalist audience. Submit a manuscript with "data are" and expect scathing reviews impugning your pet goat's morels[^1] from an avant-garde grammatician. Fortunately, there was concensus on one topic (no mere 97% here), the chironomid date from Lake Żabińskie were plural.

It is not even clear that the currently uploaded data are the correct data.


[^1]: Admit it, if the morels weren't fly-blown, your amoral goat would have eaten them (and you would be amorel).
